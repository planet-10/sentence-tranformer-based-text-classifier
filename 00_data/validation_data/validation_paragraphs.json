On the other hand, the assessment of suppliers according to ecological and social criteria is also a part of it. In this context, respect for human rights in the supply chain is of vital importance. Arbonia also pays attention to maximum sustainability with its suppliers. Since more than 96% of used materials are sourced from suppliers in Europe, a high standard is already enshrined in law."

In all countries in which it is active, it complies with the United Nations' General Declaration on Human Rights, the UN Convention on overcoming discrimination against women, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and additional international humans rights protection standards. In the reporting year, Arbonia also initiated the accession to the UN Global Compact and has committed to supporting the implementation of the ten principles in the sub-areas of human rights, labour standards, environmental protection and fighting corruption.

Starting in 2022, this assessment is to be mapped on the new e-procurement platform of the Group. For evaluation of the suppliers, external key figures (e. g. Creditworthiness, risk indicators, ESG ratings) are also to be collected and combined with the internally generated data for a holistic assessment in the future. For this purpose, Arbonia decided in the reporting year to procure external ESG ratings via EcoVadis starting on 1 January 2022. The aim is to check how many suppliers and what portion of the purchasing volume is covered by an ESG assessment. Suppliers already have to guarantee that human rights are respected and, in particular, that child labour and forced labour are prevented.",
            "For example, 80% of the direct expenditures are covered by supply agreements with the most important suppliers. These include ecological aspects (e. g. environmental protection, prohibited substances) and social issues (e. g. respect for human rights, prohibition of child, forced and compulsory labour). The division checks the suppliers' positions on the regulations concerning prohibited materials annually. In addition, Sabiana has initiated a data survey to check the positions of the suppliers on the topic of conflict minerals (3TG).",

For this reason, a strategic category management was further expanded in the division during the reporting year. This continuously collects and evaluates market information to react to potential risks in the supply chain early on."
